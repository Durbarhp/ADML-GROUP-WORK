This project focuses on fault detection in wind turbines using control charts
and sensor diagnostics. By developing a model based on data from healthy
turbines, we aim to capture faults in malfunctioning turbines. The approach
involves creating multivariate control charts, specifically T2 and SPEx charts,
to monitor performance and anomalies in the process.

You can find weekly reports and codes for this project in this repo.

First submission report basically talks about the overview of the project and the 
structure of the data used in this project. Associate code: ADML-GROUP-WORK
/windturbine 2.m

Second submission report contains the data pretreament methods and some visualization 
done to get much insight from the data. Associate code: windturbine group.m

Remaining Codes: Model definition, Visualization of results, incoperation of reviews from 
colleagues and teaching assistant.
